# MyERC721

A little proof-of-concept for implementing an ERC 721 token on the Ethereum blockchain with Solidity.

It mainly follows the ERC 721 implementation from [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/), including a metadata URI that provides additional token information for token trading platforms like [OpenSea.io](https://opensea.io/).

Additionally, token minters are allowed to update the metadata URI.
